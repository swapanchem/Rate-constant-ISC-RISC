#...............Input data........................................................................

Number of normal modes = 
108

Nunmber of time interval (nunmber of points) (M1) =
20000

Upper limit (TMAX) of time in second = 
10E-012

Lower limit (TMIN) of time in second = 
-10E-012

Temperature (T) in Kelvin = 
300

Damping parameter (ETA) in cm^(-1) =
100

Energy gap between S1 (lowest excited singlet) and TL (lowest triplet) in eV = 
-0.25


SOC between S1 and TL in cm^(-1) = 
0.02




#.............Input files...................................................................................

You have to provide the following required files in the same folder where the code is being executed. 

1. J.TXT (Duschinsky rotation (J) matrix between the S1 and the TL states)
2. D.TXT (Displacement vector (D) between S1 and TL states)
3. WS1.TXT (Vibrational frequencies of the S1 state)
4. WTL.TXT (Vibrational frequencies of the TL state)

#............................For computing the direct spin-orbit induced reverse intersystem crossing rate constant.................................................

For the direct spin-orbit induced reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate, the required data and files are N, M1, TMIN, TMAX, TEMP, ETA, DELE-S1-TL, SOC-S1-TL, J.TXT, D.TXT, WS1.TXT and WT1.TXT, respectively.


# In this case the rate constant found as K_RISC_DSO_REAL after running the code, has been computed following the Simpson's one-third rule for the integration of the time dependent correlation function.


Alternatively, you can also use the following Fast Fourier transformation technique for the evaluation of the rate constant in the frequency domain.

#........................Fast Fourier transformation West (FFTW)........................

The computed time-dependent correlation function can be transformed into the frequency domain (energy domain) by using FFTW and then the rate constant correponding to the DELE-S1-TL is evaluated.

For this FFTW, you can use the FFTW package.


The first and second columns of RISC_DSO_CORR.TXT file contain the time and real part of the time-dependent correlation functions in atomic unit, respectively. You have to convert the data into the real unit (rate constant in sec^(-1)) by multiplying a unit transformation factor.
