You have to install gfortran, mpi and LAPACK/BLAS library for successfully running the code.

Before running the code you should have all the required data and files as described in the input_dso_sv_isc.txt file. According to your system you should have chnage the value of all the required data.

# Run the intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.f90 program using the following two commands

gfortran -c determinant_module_complex_SV_ISC.f90

# For running the code parallelly 

mpif90 -o intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.exe intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.f90 determinant_module_complex_SV_ISC.o -llapack -lblas   # in some cases it should be -lscalapack -lopenblas instead of -llapack -lblas

# Execute the program 
mpirun -n $number ./intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.exe   # $number should be replaced by the number of processors used 

For serial running you have to change the $number to 1. 

Otherwise you can use the following commnads for serial running  

gfortran -o intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.exe intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.f90 determinant_module_complex_SV_ISC.o -llapack -lblas   # in some cases it should be -lscalapack -lopenblas instead of -llapack -lblas

# Execute the program 

./intersystem-crossing-rate-constant-dso-sv-interaction-finite-temp.exe 

# Collect the data
